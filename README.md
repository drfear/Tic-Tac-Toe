# Tic-Tac-Toe

## Running

- There are no special instructions to run the project
- Testing is normal as well

## Notes

- I have structured the app without dependency injection but I have tried to demonstrate the benefits of using dependency injection in my tests with the `DateProvider` protocol as well as the `PersistentStorage` protocol.

- The app is not exhaustively testted but I have done a fairly good job of testing a couple of key components

- The app is missing name editing although I had set it up with the intention of allowing users to change their display name.
